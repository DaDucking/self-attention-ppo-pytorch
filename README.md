## Self-Attention PPO Pytorch

I was inspired by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03367.pdf) which described few methods to approach for `Attention` for `Reinforcement Learning`.  
I decided that it will be best to implement simplest one.

This implementation don't have to be correct even though it works better than version without `Attention`.

### TODO:

- Benchmark for other games and other algos
